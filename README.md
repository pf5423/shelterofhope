# Shelter of Hope
Shelter of Hope was a website created as part of a community initiative to combat teenage youth homelessness in the South Florida area. Partnering with the [FLITE Center of South Florida](https://flitecenter.org/) and multiple high schools, thousands of dollars worth of funds and supplies have been raised to help alleviate homelessness.
